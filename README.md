# Learn-JAVA--multithreading

# Process vs Thread
1. Process is a software or a program which include multiple functionalities. Each process will have a separate memory space, resources allocated so that you can complete tasks. 
2. Thread is a segment of a process. In a process, multiple threads can present. Each thread can perform, for example, a functionality of the software. 
3. Threads will be working sequentially or concurrently in order to complete tasks of the process. 

# Multitasking
1. Means doing multiple tasks simlutenously. In computing,we want to multitasking because we want to utilise the CPU processing power efficiently. We can complete more tasks within shorter time and reduce the idle time. This comes down to handling user-request at a faster pace.
2. Multitasking includes multiprocessing and multithreading
3. Multi-processing means multiple programs/ applicaitons running concurrently on your computer. Each time you start an applications ( browser, MS word, etc) a process is created. When you start multiple applications, multiple processes are created and running cocurrently on your system. If a process is crashed, it wont affect the others. 
4. Multi-threading allows parts of the program running concurrently ( e.g: watching the video + listening to the audio of the video).One thread might be responsible for playing the video, another thread is responsible for playing the audio. If one thread is crashed, it will affect the other thread because threads need to work together to complete the major task.  

# Multi-threading in JAVA 

1. In Java, it can be achieved via Thread class. 
2. Thread scheduler decides which thread to run and which thread to wait
3. All of this are pretty similar to process scheduler in your operating system. 

# Main thread
1. When Java program starts, one thread is created by JVM automatically and it run immediately. This thread is "main" thread. When we write a program and run without creating a new thread, we are running in single thread environment.
2. Main thread is responsible for starting the program, setting up necs resources and spawning child threads to perform concurent tasks.   
3. Main thread is normally where we create a new thread ( spawn a new thread). The new thread created is called a child thread of the main thread
4. Main thread normally the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions. The main thread waits for all other threads to complete their executions before it itself finishes. This is to ensure that all parallel tasks have been completed and resources are properly managed. 
5. Various shutdown actions such as: cleaning up resources ( closing files, releasing network connections); ensuring all child threads are terminated gracefully; performing final logging or cleanup tasks
6. One common way to ensure the main thread waits for child threads to complete is by using the join() method. This method blocks the main thread until the specified child thread terminates.

# User-defined thread
 Two ways of creating a Thread: extending Thread class or implementing Runnable interface. 

 ## creating a thread as a child of the Thread class

 Step 1: Create a class that extends the Thread class: 

 ```java
 public class A extends Thread {

 }
 ```

 Step 2: Override the run method of the Thread class. This is the function that we want this new child thread to run. Note that: to override any method, we needs to keep the method definition as it is, no changing to parameters or return type. 

 ```java
 public class A extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run(){
        //code
    }
 }
 ```
Step 3: Write logic of run() method . 

Step 4: In main method, create an instance of the newly created child Thread class

```java
A t1 = new A();
```

Now we want to inform JVM that t1 is the new thread created and you can execute it when you are free. To inform JVM, we call .start() method of the Thread class

Step 5: start the thread : t1.start() 

When you start() the thread t1.start() multiple times, Illegal Thread State Exception will be thrown. This is caused inside the .start() method by: 

```java
...
if (threadStatus != 0)
            throw new IllegalThreadStateException();

```

when you create a thread, the thread has "new" status. It becomes 0 when you start it. When you start() again, the status is modified from 0, so it results in !=0 and exeption is thrown. 

If no exeption is thown, private native void start0() is evoked. The return type " native" indicates that this methods involves directly with the CPU and memory allocation related. Start0 () is responsible for creating your new thread and evoke run() method. Test: if we evoke run() diretly, e.g: t1.run() without going through t1.start() --> no new thread is created. 

The run() method we overridden in the thread child class is executed instead of the parents' run method.

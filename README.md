# Learn-JAVA--multithreading

# Process vs Thread
1. Process is a software or a program which include multiple functionalities. Each process will have a separate memory space, resources allocated so that you can complete tasks. 
2. Thread is a segment of a process. In a process, multiple threads can present. Each thread can perform, for example, a functionality of the software. 
3. Threads will be working sequentially or concurrently in order to complete tasks of the process. 

# Multitasking
1. Means doing multiple tasks simlutenously. In computing,we want to multitasking because we want to utilise the CPU processing power efficiently. We can complete more tasks within shorter time and reduce the idle time. This comes down to handling user-request at a faster pace.
2. Multitasking includes multiprocessing and multithreading
3. Multi-processing means multiple programs/ applicaitons running concurrently on your computer. Each time you start an applications ( browser, MS word, etc) a process is created. When you start multiple applications, multiple processes are created and running cocurrently on your system. If a process is crashed, it wont affect the others. 
4. Multi-threading allows parts of the program running concurrently ( e.g: watching the video + listening to the audio of the video).One thread might be responsible for playing the video, another thread is responsible for playing the audio. If one thread is crashed, it will affect the other thread because threads need to work together to complete the major task.  

# Multi-threading in JAVA 

1. In Java, it can be achieved via Thread class. 
2. Thread scheduler decides which thread to run and which thread to wait
3. All of this are pretty similar to process scheduler in your operating system. 

# Main thread
1. When Java program starts, one thread is created by JVM automatically and it run immediately. This thread is "main" thread. When we write a program and run without creating a new thread, we are running in single thread environment.
2. Main thread is responsible for starting the program, setting up necs resources and spawning child threads to perform concurent tasks.   
3. Main thread is normally where we create a new thread ( spawn a new thread). The new thread created is called a child thread of the main thread
4. Main thread normally the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions. The main thread waits for all other threads to complete their executions before it itself finishes. This is to ensure that all parallel tasks have been completed and resources are properly managed. 
5. Various shutdown actions such as: cleaning up resources ( closing files, releasing network connections); ensuring all child threads are terminated gracefully; performing final logging or cleanup tasks
6. One common way to ensure the main thread waits for child threads to complete is by using the join() method. This method blocks the main thread until the specified child thread terminates.
